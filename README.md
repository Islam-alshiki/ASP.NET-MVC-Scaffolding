# ASP.NET-MVC-Scaffolding
A GitHub repository of the Codeplex Mvc Scaffolding Project (https://mvcscaffolding.codeplex.com/)
This project is a continuation of the work done by Steve Sanderson & Scott Hanselman on developing MvcScaffolding. 

The original source can be found at: https://mvcscaffolding.codeplex.com/

The original is no longer supported by the original authors as they've now introduced an alternative Asp.Net Scaffolding (http://www.asp.net/visual-studio/overview/2013/aspnet-scaffolding-overview) to Visual Studio. However, this leaves users of the MvcScaffolding project in the lurch if they wish to continue to use their own templates and scripts with Visual Studio 2013 and above.

This project fixes the issues users were experiencing and has been tested with:
* Visual Studio 2013
* Visual Studio 2015
* Visual Studio 2017

The NuGet packages can be found in the following addresses: 
* [T4Scaffolding.Core.VS2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/T4Scaffolding.Core.VS2015/) (VS2013/VS2015)
* [T4Scaffolding.VS2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/T4Scaffolding.VS2015/) (VS2013/VS2015)
* [MvcScaffolding.VS2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvcScaffolding.VS2015/) (VS2013/VS2015)

* [MvcScaffolding.VS2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvcScaffolding.VS2017/)

Happy Scaffolding!
